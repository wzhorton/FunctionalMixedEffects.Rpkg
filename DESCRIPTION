Title: Functional Mixed Effects Modeling via Bayesian Penalized Splines
Version: 1.2.2
Author: W. Z. Horton

Description: Mixed effects modeling for functional data. Specifically, the
  package handles functional outcomes being regressed against non-functional
  covariates. Fixed effects and random effects are handled through the prior
  structure. The backend is handled through the FunctionalMixedEffects.jl Julia
  backend code, which also contains more information about the model.
